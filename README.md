Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to insights delivery through dashboards and presentations.
The objective is to analyze the dataset, extract meaningful insights using Python and SQL, and communicate results effectively using Power BI and a professional presentation (Gamma).

This project showcases practical skills relevant to data analyst roles, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and business-focused reporting.

Dataset

Source: (Add dataset source – e.g., Kaggle, internal dataset, public API)

Format: CSV / Excel

Size: (Number of rows & columns)

Description:
The dataset contains structured data related to (briefly explain what the data represents, e.g., sales transactions, customer behavior, financial metrics).

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

PostgreSQL: Data storage and SQL querying

Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma: Presentation (PPT) for insights storytelling

Jupyter Notebook: Analysis and documentation

Project Workflow / Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using pandas

Performed initial inspection (shape, data types, missing values)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and patterns

Identified outliers and inconsistencies

Used visualizations to understand key relationships

3. Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing and duplicate values

Standardized column names and formats

Created derived metrics where required

Ensured data quality for analysis and reporting

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL

Wrote SQL queries to:

Filter and aggregate data

Perform joins

Answer business-driven questions

Validated results between Python and SQL outputs

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL

Designed interactive dashboards with:

KPIs

Filters and slicers

Trend and comparison visuals

Focused on clarity and business relevance

6. Presentation (Gamma)

Summarized insights into a professional presentation

Highlighted:

Key findings

Business impact

Actionable recommendations

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

High-level KPIs for quick decision-making

Interactive filters for deeper analysis

Clear visual storytelling for non-technical stakeholders

(Include screenshots or a Power BI Service link if available)

Results & Key Insights

Identified major trends and patterns within the data

Highlighted key drivers impacting performance

Delivered actionable insights supported by data

Demonstrated the ability to translate raw data into business value

How This Project Is Kept Simple & Recruiter-Friendly

Clear structure: Logical flow from data ingestion to insights

Business focus: Analysis driven by real-world questions

Clean visuals: Dashboards designed for clarity, not clutter

Reproducibility: Well-organized notebooks and SQL queries

Communication: Insights presented in both dashboard and PPT format

Future Improvements

Automate data refresh pipelines

Add more advanced SQL queries or window functions

Incorporate predictive analytics
